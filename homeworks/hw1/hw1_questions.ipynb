        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using direct mail solicitations to over 50,000 prior donors of a non-profit organization, the experiment tests how different matching grant offers affect the likelihood and amount of donations. The study finds that announcing a match offer significantly increases both the revenue per solicitation and the likelihood of receiving donations, but higher matching ratios ($2:$1, $3:$1) do not significantly boost donations compared to a $1:$1 ratio. The study also tested on heterogeneous treatment effects to observe the differences in political environments across different solicitees. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Brief summary of the experiment:   \n",
        "- Participants: 50,083 prior donors to a liberal nonprofit organization.   \n",
        "- Methodology: Donors were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of several matching grant conditions, where their donations would be matched at different ratios. The control group received a standard donation request, while treatment groups received requests indicating that their donations would be matched by a leadership donor.   \n",
        "- Variables Tested:  \n",
        "    - Matching ratios: $1:$1, $2:$1, and $3:$1.  \n",
        "    - Maximum matching amounts: $25,000; $50,000; $100,000; unstated.  \n",
        "    - Suggested donation amounts: based on the donor's highest previous contribution, increased by 25% and 50%.  \n",
        "- Outcome Measures: Donation frequency (response rate) and amount donated (revenue per solicitation).  \n",
        "- Impact of Matching on Donations: Announcing a match increased donations by 19% and likelihood of donating by 22%.\n",

The t-statistic for the treatment variable is also 3.101, which corresponds with the t-test result, and the p-value is 0.002, confirming the finding from the t-test.

However, the effectiveness of different match sizes appears to have a ceiling effect, where increasing the match ratio above 1:1 offers no additional advantage. The amount donated seems to be independent of the match offer, indicating that once individuals decide to donate, their generosity is not swayed by the leverage of their donation being matched.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our exploration using simulation provided a practical demonstration of statistical theorems and reinforced the original findings. The importance of such matching schemes in fundraising efforts is clear—they are effective at increasing participation rates in charitable giving, but the complexity of the matching offer does not significantly impact the donation behavior among those who decide to give.\n"
